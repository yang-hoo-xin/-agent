# Implementation Queue

Status: active and conditional work only
Last updated: 2026-07-23

Authority and reading order are defined only by `AGENTS.md` section 2.
Completed, frozen, review, and superseded records belong in
`docs/audits/LOOP_HISTORY.md`, not in this queue.

## 1. Current Queue

```text
current_queue: None
selected_product_request: None
```

`PHASE2B-BETTERHITFEEDBACK-ENABLED-001` completed its selected real-runtime
claim boundary and moved to `docs/audits/LOOP_HISTORY.md`. No replacement task
is selected automatically. The next queue item requires a concrete product
request, an observed failure, or a bounded product decision with current
evidence and explicit permissions.

The two known Harness observability defects remain recorded but do not activate
a platform task by themselves: successful raw Patch Generation response
persistence is missing, and the nested pre-call model count can remain stale.
They may enter the queue only when a selected product run is blocked or its
claim cannot be reconstructed because of one of those defects.

## 2. Entry Rule

A task may enter the active queue only when all of the following are recorded:

1. one concrete product capability, real Mod request, observed failure, or
   bounded product decision;
2. exact current source/configuration/log evidence for the touched identifiers;
3. explicit dependencies and permission/disclosure boundaries;
4. the affected coverage rows and focused verification command;
5. a stopping condition that returns work to the product mainline.

Do not activate work solely because a SPEC, frozen plan, historical review, or
open gap describes it.

## 3. Conditional Work

| Work area | Trigger required before queue entry | Current disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ProposalCritic external-model adapter | A selected proposal-review task explicitly requires a separate model assessment, exact data disclosure is approved for that run, and the local/injected boundary is insufficient | Conditional; local/injected boundary only |
| Specialist fan-out or bounded ReAct | A selected task contains separable risk dimensions or an observed fixed-step failure that changes a decision | Conditional; no always-on swarm or top-level ReAct migration |
| Reference/community knowledge loader | Authentic, traceable material exists and a selected product task cannot proceed adequately with current source/live reads | Conditional; community synthetic fixture remains plumbing only |
| Symbol/structured retrieval deepening | A selected product task records a structural lookup failure that current `rg` plus live reads cannot resolve efficiently | Conditional; current retrieval direction remains `rg` plus live reads |
| Formal retrieval validation | A precise promotion-grade or cross-project claim is required | Conditional; Arms A-G and H1-H5 are not active |
| Dense, RRF, rerank, or Agentic routing | A recorded semantic-recall failure persists after deterministic retrieval and a bounded decision experiment is approved | Conditional; no production RAG direction is active |
| Dashboard polish | A real operator or demonstration task records an inspection gap in existing artifact projections | Conditional |
| MCP write/runtime route | A selected external MCP client must drive an approved controlled workflow action | Conditional; read/report boundary remains sufficient |
| GTFO launch, copy, or gameplay evidence | A selected Mod acceptance criterion requires it and the user separately approves exact launch/copy actions | Conditional |
| Production ArtifactStore hardening | A real delivery task exposes recovery, concurrency, history-query, migration, or retention failure | Conditional |
| Long-term memory/closed-loop automation | Repeated verified tasks expose a recurrence or retrieval failure that manually recorded lessons cannot solve | Conditional; history is not trusted policy memory |

## 4. Task Record Template

When a task is activated, add only this bounded record:

```text
task_id:
product_request_or_failure:
exact_evidence:
affected_coverage_ids:
dependencies:
permissions_and_disclosure:
files_in_scope:
focused_verification:
stop_condition:
status: active
```

Move the record to `docs/audits/LOOP_HISTORY.md` when it becomes completed,
frozen, superseded, or review-only. Do not keep a second completed-work table in
this file.
